# Pomodoro

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they haveâ€”rather than against it.
Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.

I've built this application for more productivity and time management.
This application has 25 minutes work time with 5 minutes intervals for 5 tasks.
This application keeps track of work minutes and intervals.
